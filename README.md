**Stellar Address Kit** is a specialized, multi-language library designed to solve the complexity of deposit routing on the Stellar network. It provides a unified, spec-compliant way to handle G-addresses (classic), M-addresses (muxed), and C-addresses (contracts) across TypeScript, Go, and Dart.

## Use Cases

- **Exchange Deposit Reconciliation**: Reliably identify incoming payments, correctly extracting the routing ID whether it arrives via a Muxed address or a standard Memo, while automatically flagging non-canonical formatting.
- **Wallet Address Input Forms**: Prevent users from making mistakes (like sending payments to a Contract address or entering a Memo alongside an M-address) with real-time UI warnings.
- **Compliance & Security Firewalls**: Automatically quarantine deposits from contract-senders or invalid destinations before they affect user balances.
- **Cross-Platform Parity**: Ensure identical deposit routing behavior whether your backend is written in Go, your frontend in TypeScript, or your mobile app in Flutter.

## Core Features

- **Spec-First Design**: Guaranteed identical behavior across all three languages via a shared test vector suite.
- **Precision Safety**: Built-in protection against 64-bit integer precision loss in JavaScript and Flutter Web.
- **Warning System**: Discriminated unions (TS) or structured objects (Go/Dart) to catch edge cases like numeric `MEMO_TEXT`.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Core logic is lightweight and has zero external dependencies beyond standard library features.

## Quick Example

Extract canonical routing information from any address type (G, M, or C) with zero-throw safety.

```typescript
import { extractRouting } from "stellar-address-kit";

// Handles M-addresses, G-addresses with memos, and C-addresses
const result = extractRouting({
  address:
    "MA7QYNF7SOWQ3GLR2BGMZEHXAVIRZA4KVWLT7AV7Y6S33Z6S3CHBAAAAAAAAAAAAABQD",
});

console.log(result.address); // "GA7Q..."
console.log(result.routingId); // "123"
```
